This Module 3 Challenge was built around creating a password generator from the input of the user. I took an interesting approach that captured the inputs and set them to an array. I split the problem into two and took everything but the last array and calculated how many characters each specified character would have and then calculated the remainder for the last specified character. If there was one character chosen then the function would simply run though the single specficied charcter if statement. In the end, the arrays created would be combined and randomized to create a password between 8-128 characters.
